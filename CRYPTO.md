# Cryptography
Cryptography can be defined as the study and practice of techniques for
modes of secure communication in the presence of malicious third parties. It
involves formulating and maintaining protocols and algorithms to transform
a given ***plaintext*** (message to be hidden) into a secure ***ciphertext*** (the hidden
message to be transmitted).
